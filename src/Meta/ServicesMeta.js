                    "An A-frame board is essentially a double-sided poster frame than stands outside a shop or business to drive traffic inside. That means the only thing you’ll need to design is the poster!",
                    "First things first, you’ll need to choose one of the sizes we offer; either A2 poster frames or A0 if you want a really large poster frame!",
                    "Then, make your poster design to the size you’ve chosen. Make sure you add 3mm bleed area to each side to account for the bleed area and remember than a very slight area (around 10mm on each side) around the edges of the poster won’t be visible when it’s attached to the frame – just keep your main message central!",
                    "The same poster is used on both sides of the A-frame sign so you only need one design. If you want to switch up or change your posters, you don’t need to order another A-frame – just order a new set of 220mic PVC posters to replace them.",

                    "An A-frame sign really makes a statement, but they work especially well in places where lots of people pass by – like busy roadsides and shopping streets. We print your graphics on a weatherproof stock and the stand itself is made from brushed aluminium, meaning they’re ideal for outdoor use to tempt customers in. They’re especially popular amongst restaurants and cafes, because it’s an eye-catching way to promote offers and specials.",
                    "A-frame poster holders aren’t just for pavements and street corners! They also make a big impact when used indoors to advertise sales and promotions."
